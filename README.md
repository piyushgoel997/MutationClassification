Things that can be done - Bootstrapping, a histogram  with the ouput prob on the x-axis and the number of positive and negative examples with that prob

DONE - roc curves, 10-fold validation, increase/decrease hidden layers

Doesn't work - make the likely ones to be 0.8 and 0.2 or something (but how do I make the val, test data in this case)

Got better results when using 1D convolution instead of 2D convolution, actually makes sense because the data is a 1D sequence and if we make it 2D most of the inputs would nevertheless be 0.
