This is the Mutation Classification project done completely by Piyush Goel for the course CS6140 Machine Learning (Spring 2020 by Prof. Predrag Radivojac).
The detailed project report is in the report folder. The file data.csv contains the data used for this project (though it is the preprocessed and cleaned version of the data from the ClinVar and UniProt databases). The file Classifier.ipynb contains the actual classification and evaluation code.
